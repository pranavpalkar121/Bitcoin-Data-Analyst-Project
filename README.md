## Bitcoin Data Analysis Project 🪙📊

### Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing Bitcoin price data to uncover market trends, volatility, and key insights. It includes time-series analysis, OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) examination, and interactive visualizations to better understand Bitcoin's price behavior over time.


### Project Features 🚀
- ✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, formatted date-time, and removed duplicates.
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Analyzed price changes, trends, and volatility.
- ✅ **Visualizations** – Created static & interactive charts for better insights.
- ✅ **OHLC Analysis** – Studied Bitcoin's daily trading range using candlestick charts.
- ✅ **Log-scale & Trend Analysis** – Compared normal & log-scale price movement.
- ✅ **Yearly, Quarterly, and Monthly Breakdown** – Examined long-term and short-term trends.
- ✅ **Daily Price Change Analysis** – Investigated daily percentage fluctuations.

### Libraries Used 🛠️
The following Python libraries were utilized for data analysis and visualization:
- 👌 `pandas` – Data manipulation & preprocessing.
- 👌 `numpy` – Numerical computations & log transformations.
- 👌 `matplotlib` – Basic static visualizations.
- 👌 `seaborn` – Statistical & heatmap visualizations.
- 👌 `plotly` – Interactive charts for deeper insights.
